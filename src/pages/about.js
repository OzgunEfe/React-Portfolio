            <p>Hello! My name is Ozgun and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2018 when I decided to try to set up my photography portfolio website.</p>
            <p>After working as a project manager, I realized what interested me was web development and I started working to change my career. Now I'm working as a Frond-End developer.</p>
            <p>Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:</p>
            <ul className="list">
                <li>React</li>
                <li>Bootstrap</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>Node.js</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    )
