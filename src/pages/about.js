        <p>
          As a recent graduate of a front-end development Bootcamp, I bring a
          unique combination of mechanical engineering and tech skills to the
          table. I have honed my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript abilities, and have
          experience in creating dynamic websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          My project management background has taught me the importance of
          effective communication and collaboration. I am confident in my
          ability to approach problems from different angles and find creative
          solutions, with a focus on delivering quality results. I am eager to
          bring my expertise, passion for technology, and project management
          experience to a new role as a front-end developer.
